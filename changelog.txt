Done:
* applied a linter
* added confirm button and gene input validation
* encapsulated data inside reactiveval so it is only loaded once at startup
* added time debugging
* added progress bars (7/11)


Issues:
* correl plot doesn't work. Heatmap expects vsd to be numeric matrix
* very slow execute, ~15 seconds to load data, ~10 seconds for each gene plot

Todo:
* Add title to the pca (Done 7/11)
* add loading bar when data is being read at startup (Done 7/11)
* fix time debugging (Done 7/11)
* fix correl plot
* generate figs for memory and compute usage
* create docker file
* move UMAP gen to static file made in preprocessing
* Add programatic cluster labeling using suerat transfer label

* R package name of package stuff
* scanpy
