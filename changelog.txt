Done:
* applied a linter
* added confirm button and gene input validation
* encapsulated data inside reactiveval so it is only loaded once at startup
* added time debugging


Issues:
* time debugging returns five times
* correl plot doesn't work. Heatmap expects vsd to be numeric matrix
* very slow execute, ~15 seconds to load data, ~10 seconds for each gene plot

Todo:
* Add title to the pca
* add loading bar when data is being read at startup
* fix time debugging
* fix correl plot
* generate figs for memory and compute usage
* create docker file
